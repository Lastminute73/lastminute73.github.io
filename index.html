    <!-- Chosen Palette: Classic Casino (Stone, Deep Red, Gold) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-column layout with a fixed navigation sidebar listing all games. Clicking a game name dynamically shows its rules in the main content area. This is chosen over a simple scrollable document for rapid, on-the-fly rule lookup during a fast-paced game night, enhancing usability by providing instant access to specific information. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Game: Rules Text -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Structured HTML/CSS Cards -> Interaction: Click-to-reveal via JS. Justification: No quantitative data exists, so charts are unnecessary. This interactive card system is the most direct and user-friendly way to present distinct blocks of text-based rules, avoiding scrolling and searching. Method: Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, Unicode icons. Confirmed NO SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
